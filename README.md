## Preprocessing and Data Analysis.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and documentation for the preprocessing and data analysis stages of the project. It outlines the steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming textual data into categorical values. Additionally, it provides insights into the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process, where descriptive statistics and visualization techniques are employed to understand the dataset's characteristics and identify patterns.

## Preprocessing and Modeling.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook file encompasses the preprocessing and modeling stages of the project. It details the techniques used for feature selection, including the rationale behind choosing specific features such as job title, company size, and experience level. The notebook also delves into the implementation of machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling, with a focus on Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Trees Regressor. Furthermore, it discusses the evaluation metrics employed to assess the performance of the models and provides insights into the limitations and reflections encountered throughout the project.
